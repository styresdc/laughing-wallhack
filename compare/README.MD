# Problem
We want to be able to compare songs using echonest.

# Question
1. What information does echonest provide?
2. How do you get data for a song?
3. What types of data do we want to compare?

# Resources
1. [Pyechonest Track]


### 1. Mini-abstract and relevance
The pyechonest track module provides detailed data and track analysis for easy comparasin of songs. The hardest part is simpy to decide what you would like to compare.

### 1. How should we approach a transition?
Transitions have been an integral part of composing music since inception, and have more recently become an art post-composure; the modern DJ. The modern DJ uses several different techniques to "mix" songs so that these transitions are well planned, and cohesive. Luckily, they have the advantage of leeway in planning these transitions, the part we are interested in is how they do this in real time. 

### 2. What elements make a good transition?
Mixing is the art of taking two or more pieces of music and combining them into a single work. The principle technique for mixing music is beatmatching, in which a DJ synchronizes the beats of two songs. When composing music, an artist may decide to completely change the entire direction of a song, done mostly by stopping and restarting. This is a perfect example of a transition within a song, so much so that the listener preceives it as a linear progression.

A good tranition should sound like a linear progresion through a song.

### 3. Techniques for a good transition.
Modern technology has given us the ability to quickly analyze and download a heard song to our phones based on simply a 15
second analysis. How can we use this in our research. Creating a algorithim to so this is simply neccesary to finding the optimal way to compare songs.

### 4. Where to go from here?
We need to find a databse that suits are needs, and to create a python fucntion that like the infinte jukebox can hash a song and retunrn a value based on its attributes.
While looking for simaler songs to switch between, we can fingerprint it and compare it to to databse.

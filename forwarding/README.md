### 1. How should we approach a transition?
Transitions have been an integral part of composing music since inception, and have more recently become an art post-composure; the modern DJ. The modern DJ uses several different techniques to "mix" songs so that these transitions are well planned, and cohesive. Luckily, they have the advantage of leeway in planning these transitions, the part we are interested in is how they do this in real time. 

### 2. What elements make a good transition?
Mixing is the art of taking two or more pieces of music and combining them into a single work. The principle technique for mixing music is beatmatching, in which a DJ synchronizes the beats of two songs. When composing music, an artist may decide to completely change the entire direction of a song, done mostly by stopping and restarting. This is a perfect example of a transition within a song, so much so that the listener preceives it as a linear progression.

A good transition should sound like a linear progresion through a song.

### 3. Techniques for a good transition.
As we talked about earlier DJ's use an advance suite of tools to make good transtitioins, we can gain many of the same tools through remix. Mainly,

Beatmatching
Beatmatching is a technique used to align the beats of two songs so that they are in sync with each other. In order for the beats to be in sync, two things must be true:

The songs are playing at the same tempo i.e. the time between beats is the same in both songs.
The beats must be in phase i.e. rhythmic notes (bass drum, snare drum, etc.) occur at the same times.
Transitions DJ has two buttons corresponding to items 1 and 2 that can be used to beatmatch:

Crossfading
Crossfading is a technique for transitioning from one song to another during a mix, used together with beatmatching. The usual pattern of mixing music is to have a single song playing, bringing a second song in so that both songs are playing simultaneously, and then fading out the first song out so that only the second song is playing.

A crossfade is accomplished using the crossfader, a slider that varies the volumes between two audio channels.  When the slider is positioned to the left, the song on the top deck will be heard. When the slider is positioned to the right, the song on the bottom deck will be heard. When the crossfader is positioned in the center, both songs will be heard.

Choosing the Mix Point
The previous section explains how to crossfade one song into another, but does not explain how to align the two songs to produce a good mix. In order to choose a good alignment, it's important to understand how songs are structured. If you take a look at song annotations, you will notice that most sections are 8 bars or measures in length, or equivalently, 32 beats in songs with 4 bars per beat. There are exceptions, but most music you will encounter follows this pattern: songs are broken into 8 bar/32 beat sections. It is on those section boundaries where you will want to fade in one song or fade out another. So when mixing, align the section boundaries of the two songs and then fade in and out on the boundaries.

In addition to aligning songs on their phrase boundaries, there are some rules of thumb for selecting the phrase types during which to perform a crossfade. There is much flexibility on where you choose to do a fade, but you should generally avoid fading when both songs have vocals. Intros, Choruses, Breaks, Instrumentals, and Outros are the best sections to do a fade. Verses are almost always a bad time to do a fade.

Some examples of good combinations of section types for a crossfade:

Intro over Chorus
Intro over Break
Intro over Instrumental
Intro over Outro
Chorus over Break
Chorus over Outro


### 4. Where to go from here?
We need to evaluate how exactly we'd like to transfer b/t songs. Would a crossfade approach be better than a jump? How can we change songs to be more alike through beat and pitch matching?

# Problem
We want to make infinite-playlist more user friendly through a GUI.

# Question
1. What GUI options are avaliable?
2. System Caveats
3. User Caveats

# Resources
1. [GUI Programming]
2. [Million Song Dataset Code]
3. [Pyechonest Show Attrs Example]

### 1. Mini-abstract and relevance of [GUI Programming]
Python while mainly used for server-side productions has like most O-O languages the ability to create resourcefull and intiutive graphical interfaces for providing a user with a front-end. In the case of python many options exist to allow for this, the important thing to note is that each has it's uses and limitatons. It will be important to select an appropriate end. This list provides many tools for

### 2. System Caveats
An integral part of interface design is the ability to translate between opertaing systems so that we can assure compatibility across multiple user platforms (Linux, OSX, Windows). While each tool has its own success areas, it is important to also choose a tool that has optimum rechability across platfomrs. I.E. it would be a nice choice to have a target of a creator being something that it is already running on, in this case Python.

wxGlade is a python oriented utility using wxWidgets to allow for an IDE written in python for development of Python. with this kind of development, we can assure compatibiliy across platforms. 

### 3.User Caveats
Another thing to keep in mind is to have the goal of a simple development.

A complicated design such as this may be usefull for experienced users, but appears daunting for a naive user. A goal we need to strive for is easiness of use in our design.

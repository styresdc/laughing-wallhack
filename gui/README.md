# Problem
Making infinite-playlist more user friendly.

# Question
1. How can we accomplish this?
2. What parts need to be implemented. 
3. What parts need to be added for playback control.

1. [GUI Guide]

### 1. Mini-abstract and relevance of [GUI Guide]
Our infinite-playlist currently does not allow for an optimaml end user experience requiring a vast knowledge of python, IDE, and modules in order for it to run correctly. It would be usefull to adapt it in such a way so that an average user may be able to interact with it easily.

Programmers have accomplished the task of user friendliness through time using GUI's to allow users to interact with complex coding in a simple user interface. 

### 2. What parts need to be implemented?
To have our GUI function in such a way that it will be usefull we need to have it implemennt our backend in a way that a user can interact with.

A simple media player interface will suffice for our needs. Allowing the user to select and view tracks as they progress over time will be usefull. Integrating maps etc. from playback will be easy enough and provide informative graphics.

### 3. What elements need to be added. 
We will also be able to implement actions such as tempo and pitch shifting as well as alternate playback controls to our application to conform to our approach.

### 4. Where to go from here?
We need to decide what controls will be neccesary to have the desired controls over playback? Also, which gui approach do we need to take to have a good product. Will cross-platform issuses be addressed?
